CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOTES FROM ROBERT CUNNINGHAM

the issue was that you had the file in github instantiated with a readme file, however, at the same time you were creating a local file on your computer called tower of hanoi, that didn't have the readme file. Because the components of code in the local and on github didn't match up you could push the tower of hanoi to github because they didn't make. 

in summary: 
make sure the code in the local and github match up and praise the following code: 


other notes:

add origin is referring to adding the code from github and connecting it to the code on the computer 

there are three stages of files:
1. unaccounted for files - when you do status it gets put in red
2. staged files - when it's green and ready to be committed files
3. committed - when it's committed and is uploaded to github

at the bottom here is a test to write code on github and pull it to git - this was a success - just did git pull
